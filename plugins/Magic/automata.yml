#
# Modify this file to add or remove automata.
#
# An automaton is a virtual block that can cast spells, spawn mobs or show effects.
# Each automaton in-game inherits from one of the configured automata in this file,
# but can be customized in-game.
#
# You can add new automata in this file or modify the builtin ones. Use load_default_automata: false
# in config.yml to remove the default attributes completely.
#
# You can also add individual files to the automata/ folder
#
# To see the current default builtin configs, look in this folder:
# https://github.com/elBukkit/MagicPlugin/tree/master/Magic/src/main/resources/defaults/automata
#
# For customization help see:
